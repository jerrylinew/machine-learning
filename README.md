# Machine Learning Projects
Projects for Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course on Coursera

Project 1 - Implemented linear regression using gradient descent and get to see it work on data.

Project 2 - Implemented logistic regression using gradient descent and applied it to two different datasets.

Project 3 - Implemented one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.

Project 4 - Implemented the backpropagation algorithm to train a neural network and applied it to the task of hand-written digit recognition with > 99% accuracy.
